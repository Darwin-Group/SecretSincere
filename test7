PAM: Hi Jun. As you know, I've asked you here today to discuss the future of our Self-Access Centre.

帕姆：嗨，君。你知道，我今天叫你来这里讨论我们的自学中心的未来。

We have to decide what we want to do about this very important resource for our English language students.

我们必须决定我们希望如何处理这个对于英语语言学生非常重要的资源。

So, can you tell me what the students think about this?

所以，可否告诉我学生怎么想的？

JUN: Well, from the students' point of view, we would like to keep it.

君：嗯，从学生的角度，我们想要保留它。

The majority of students say that they enjoy using it because it provides a variation on the classroom routine and they see it as a pretty major component of their course, but we would like to see some improvements to the equipment, particularly the computers; there aren't enough for one each at the moment and we always have to share.

大部分学生说他们喜欢使用它，因为它为课堂学习以外提供变化，他们认为它是课程很重要的组成部分，但我们希望设备能有改善，特别是电脑；现在不够人手一台，我们总要共用。

PAM: Well yes, the teachers agree that it is a very valuable resource but one thing we have noticed is that a lot of the students are using it to check their personal emails.

帕姆：是的，老师们也同意这是非常有价值的资源，但我们注意到一件事，很多学生使用它查看个人邮件。

We don't want to stop you students using it, but we think the computers should be used as a learning resource, not for emails.

我们不想阻止学生使用它，但我们认为电脑是用来学习的资源，不是查看电邮。

Some of us also think that we could benefit a lot more by relocating the Self-Access Centre to the main University library building.

我们中一些人也认为把自学中心搬到主图书馆的楼里会更好。

How do you think the students would feel about that, Jun?

君，你认为学生对这个会怎么想？

JUN: Well, the library is big enough to incorporate the Self-Access Centre, but it wouldn't be like a class activity anymore.

君：嗯，图书馆足够大，能容纳自主学习中心，但是它就不像是课程活动了。

Our main worry would be not being able to go to a teacher for advice.

一个主要的担忧是没法去问老师意见了。

I'm sure there would be plenty of things to do but we really need teachers to help us choose the best activities.

我确定会有很多事情做，但我们真需要老师你们给帮忙选择最好的活动。

PAM: Well, there would still be a teacher present and he or she would guide the activities of the students, we wouldn't just leave them to get on with it.

帕姆：好吧，还是会有一个老师在场，他或她会指导学生的活动，我们不会丢下他们。

JUN: Yes, but I think the students would be much happier keeping the existing set-up; they really like going to the Self-Access Centre with their teacher and staying together as a group to do activities.

君：是的，但是我觉得如果可以保留现有的模式，学生们会更高兴；他们真心喜欢和老师们一起去自学中心，在一起作为一个小组做活动。

If we could just improve the resources and facilities, I think it would be fine.

如果只是改善资源和设备，我觉得就可以了。

Is the cost going to be a problem?

花费会是问题吗？

PAM: It's not so much the expense that I'm worried about, and we've certainly got room to do it, but it's the problem of timetabling a teacher to be in there outside class hours.

帕姆：倒不是因为我担心费用，我们已经得到了一定的预算去做这个，倒是问题在于在课外时间给老师排课。

If we're going to spend a lot of money on equipment and resources, we really need to make sure that everything is looked after properly.

如果我们要花费大量的钱在设备和资源上，我们真的需要确保所有的东西都被妥善保管。

Anyway, let's make some notes to see just what needs doing to improve the Centre.

无论如何，让我们做一些笔记，看看需要做什么来改善中心。

PAM: Now, what about the computers?

帕姆：现在，电脑呢？

I think it might be a good idea to install some new models.

我认为安装一些新的型号可能是个好主意。

They would take up a lot less room and so that would increase the work space for text books and so on.

他们会占用更少的空间，这样会留出更多工作空间给课本之类的。

JUN: That would be great. It is a bit cramped in there at times.

君：那太好了。有时那里确实有点拥挤。

PAM: What about other resources?

帕姆：其它资源呢？

Do you have a list of things that the students would like to see improved?

你有没有一个单子，学生希望看到改善的方面的？

JUN: Yes, one of the comments that students frequently make is that they find if difficult to find materials that are appropriate for their level, especially reading resources.

君：是的，一个学生们常提的意见是他们常常很难找到符合他们水平的资料，特别是阅读资料。

So I think we need to label them more clearly.

所以，我觉得我们应该更清楚的给它们打上标签。

PAM: Well that's easy enough, we can get that organised very quickly.

帕姆：那很简单，我们可以很快组织起来。

In fact I think we should review all of the study resources as some of them are looking a bit out-of-date.

实际上，我认为我们应该复查所有的学习资源，因为有一些看起来有一点过时了。

JUN: Definitely. The CD section especially needs to be more current.

君：绝对的。CD部分特别需要更新一些。

I think we should get some of the ones that go with our latest course books and also make multiple copies.

我觉得应该搭配我们最新的课程弄一些新的，并且做多个备份。

PAM: Good, now I was also thinking about some different materials that we haven't got in there at all.

帕姆：好的，现在我还考虑过我们完全没有的一些不同的资料。

What do you think of the idea of introducing some workbooks?

你觉得介绍一些新课本的主意如何？

If we break them up into separate pages and laminate them, they'd be a great resource.

如果我们把这些资料分成单独的页面并制成薄本，将会是很棒的资料。

The students could study the main course book in class and then do follow-up practice in the Self-Access Centre.

学生可以在课堂上学习主要课程教材，然后在自学中心做后续练习。

JUN: That sounds good.

君：这听起来不错。

PAM: Okay, now finally we need to think about how the room is used.

帕姆：好的，现在最后了，我们需要考虑房间的使用。

I'll have to talk to the teachers and make sure we can all reach some agreement on a timetable to supervise the centre after class.

我得和老师们聊聊，并确保我们可以对于课后监督中心的时间表达成一致。

But we also need to think about security, too.

但是我们也还要考虑安全。

Especially if we're going to invest in some new equipment.

特别是我们会投资一些新的设备。

JUN: What about putting in an alarm?

君：设置警报如何？

PAM: Good idea. The other thing I'd like to do is talk to our technicians and see whether we could somehow limit the access to email.

帕姆：好主意。另一件我得和我们的技术人员说的事情是看看能否稍微限制电子邮件的使用。

I really don't want to see that resource misused.

我实在不想看到资源被不妥善使用。

JUN: What about if we agree to only use it before and after class?

君：如果我们同意只在课堂上之前和之后使用它？

PAM: Yes, that would be fine.

帕姆：是的，这还不错。

OK, anyway ... that's great for now.

好的，无论如何……目前还不错。

We'll discuss it further when we've managed to ...

我们再继续深入讨论，如果我们能做到……
