I never really planned to be a lifeboat volunteer when I came to live in Northsea.

当我来到诺斯海生活时，我从未想过要成为一名救生艇志愿者。

I'd been working in London as a website designer, but although that was interesting, I didn't like city life.

我一直在伦敦做网站设计师，虽然工作很有趣，但我不喜欢城市生活。

I'd been really keen on boats as a teenager, and I thought if I went to live by the sea, I might be able to pursue that interest a bit more in my free time.

十几岁的时候，我就非常喜欢船，我想如果我住在海边，也许能在空闲时间更多地追求我的兴趣。

Then I found that the Lifeboat Institution was looking for volunteers, so I decided to apply.

后来我发现救生艇协会正在招募志愿者，于是我决定申请。

The Lifeboat Institution building here in Northsea's hard to miss, it's one of the largest in the country.

北海的救生艇协会大楼很显眼，它是全国最大的救生艇协会之一。

It was built 15 years ago with funds provided by a generous member of the public who'd lived here all her life.

它建于15年前，由一位慷慨的公众成员提供的资金，她在这里生活了一辈子。

As the Lifeboat Institution is a charity that relies on that kind of donation, rather than funding provided by the government, that was a huge help to us.

因为救生艇机构是一个依赖捐赠的慈善机构，而不是政府提供的资金，这对我们帮助很大。

When I applied, I had to have a health assessment.

当我申请的时候，我必须做一个健康评估。

The doctors were particularly interested in my vision.

医生非常关注我的视力。

I used to be short-sighted, so I'd had to wear glasses, but I'd had laser eye surgery two years earlier so that was OK.

我以前是近视眼，所以不得不戴眼镜，但两年前我做了激光眼科手术，所以视力没问题。

They gave me tests for colour blindness and they thought I might have a problem there, but it turned out I was OK.

他们给我做了色盲测试，他们认为我可能有问题，但结果证明我没事。

When the coastguard gets an alert, all the volunteers are contacted and rush to the lifeboat station.

当海岸警卫队收到警报时，所有的志愿者都会得到联系，并迅速赶往救生艇站。

Our target's to get there in five minutes, then we try to get the boat off the dock and out to sea in another six to eight minutes.

我们的目标是在五分钟内赶到那里，然后在六到八分钟内将船驶离码头并驶向大海。

Our team's proud that we usually achieve that – the average time across the country's eight and a half minutes.

我们团队引以为豪的是，我们通常都能做到这一点--全国的平均时间是八分半钟。

I've recently qualified as what's called a 'helmsman', which means I have the ultimate responsibility for the lifeboat.

我最近获得了所谓的 "舵手 "资格，这意味着我对救生艇负有最终责任。

I have to check that the equipment we use is in working order – the crew have special life jackets that can support up to four people in the water.

我必须检查我们使用的设备是否正常工作--船员们都有特制的救生衣，最多可支持四人下水。

And it's ultimately my decision whether it's safe to launch the boat.

最终由我来决定是否安全放行。

But it's very rare not to launch it, even in the worst weather.

但即使在最恶劣的天气下，也很少有不下水的情况。

As well as going out on the lifeboat, my work involves other things too.

除了出海救生，我的工作还包括其他方面。

A lot of people underestimate how quickly conditions can change at sea, so I speak to youth groups and sailing clubs in the area about the sorts of problems that sailors and swimmers can have if the weather suddenly gets bad.

很多人都低估了海上环境变化的速度，因此我向当地的青年团体和帆船俱乐部讲述如果天气突然变坏，水手和游泳者可能会遇到的各种问题。

We also have a lot of volunteers who organise activities to raise money for us, and we couldn't manage without them.

我们还有很多志愿者，他们组织活动为我们筹款，没有他们，我们无法开展工作。

The training we get is a continuous process, focusing on technical competence and safe handling techniques, and it's given me the confidence to deal with extreme situations without panicking.

训练是一个持续的过程，重点是技术能力和安全操作技巧，这让我有信心应对极端情况而不惊慌失措。

I was glad I'd done a first aid course before I started, as that's a big help with the casualty care activities we do.

我很高兴自己在入职前参加了急救课程，因为这对我们开展伤员救护活动大有帮助。

We've done a lot on how to deal with ropes and tie knots – that's an essential skill.

我们还学习了很多如何处理绳索和打绳结--这是一项基本技能。

After a year, I did a one-week residential course, led by specialists.

一年后，我在专家的带领下参加了为期一周的住宿课程。

They had a wave-tank where they could create extreme weather conditions – so we could get experience at what to do if the boat turned over in a storm at night, for example.

他们有一个造波水池，可以创造极端的天气状况，所以我们可以获得经验，例如如果船在夜间翻覆，在暴风雨中做什么。

Since I started, I've had to deal with a range of emergency situations.

自从我开始工作以来，我不得不处理各种紧急情况。

But the work's hugely motivating.

但这项工作给了我极大的动力。

It's not just about saving lives – I've learned a lot about the technology involved.

这不仅仅是关于拯救生命——我已经学到了很多关于相关技术的知识。

My background in IT's been useful here, and I can use my expertise to help other volunteers.

我的 IT 背景在这里很有用，我可以利用我的专业知识来帮助其他志愿者。

They're a great group – we're like a family really, which helps when you're dragging yourself out of bed on a cold stormy night.

他们是一个很棒的团队--我们就像一个大家庭，当你在寒冷的暴风雨之夜从床上爬起来时，这对你很有帮助。

But actually, it's the colder months that can be the most rewarding time.

但实际上，寒冷的月份才是最有意义的时候。

That's when the incidents tend to be more serious, and you realise that you can make a huge difference to the outcome.

这时候的事故往往更加严重，你会意识到你可以对结果产生巨大的影响。

So if any of you listeners are interested. . . .

所以，如果各位听众有兴趣. . . .
