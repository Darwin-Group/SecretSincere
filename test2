ANDREW: Now we go to Jane who is going to tell us about what's happening in town this weekend.

安德鲁：现在我们交给简，她会为大家介绍本周末的城中热事。

JANE: Right, thanks Andrew, and now on to what's new, and do we really need yet another sports shop in Bradcaster?

简：好的，谢谢安德鲁。现在开始看看新鲜事，在布莱德卡斯特尔，我们真的还需要一家运动用品商店吗？

Well, most of you probably know Sports World - the branch of a Danish sports goods company that opened a few years ago - it's attracted a lot of custom, and so the company has now decided to open another branch in the area.

大部分人应该知道运动用品世界，几年前开业的一家丹麦运动用品公司的分店，这家店吸引不少顾客，因此这家公司现在决定在该地区再新开一家分店。

It's going to be in the shopping centre to the west of Bradcaster, so that will be good news for all of you who've found the original shop in the north of the town hard to get to.

新店会位于布莱德卡斯特尔西边的购物中心内，因此，对于那些认为不便前往位于城北老店的人，这是一个好消息。

I was invited to a special preview and I can promise you, this is the ultimate in sports retailing.

我应邀预先参观，我可以向大家保证，这绝对是运动零售业的顶尖级。

The whole place has been given a new minimalist look with the company's signature colours of black and red.

整个地方都被赋予了一个新的极简主义风格，使用了具有该公司特色的黑色和红色。

The first three floors have a huge range of sports clothing as well as equipment, and on the top floor there's a café and a book and DVD section.

前三层有非常丰富的运动服饰以及器材，在顶层有一个咖啡厅以及一个书和DVD区域。

You'll find all the well-known names as well as some less well-known ones.

你会找到所有知名和一些鲜为人知的东西。

If they haven't got exactly what you want in stock they promise to get it for you in ten days.

如果他们没有你要找的东西，他们保证在十天之内到货。

Unlike the other store, where it can take up to fourteen days.

而不像另一家商店，到货需要十四天。

They cover all the major sports, including football, tennis and swimming, but they particularly focus on running, and they claim to have the widest range of equipment in the country.

这里涵盖所有主要运动类型，包括足球、网球、游泳，但他们重点卖跑步相关的。并且他们声称拥有全国最多种类的器材。

As well as that, a whole section of the third floor is devoted to sports bags, including the latest designs from the States - if you can't find what you want here, it doesn't exist!

除此之外，三层的一整个区域贡献给运动包袋，包括全美最潮的设计，如果你在这里找不到你想要的东西，这东西就根本不存在。

The shop will be open from 9.00 am this Saturday and if you go along to the opening then you'll have the chance to meet the national 400 metres running champion Paul King, who's coming along to open the shop, and he will be staying around until about midday to chat to any fans who want to meet him and sign autographs.

该店将于本周六早上9点开始营业，如果你前往开幕典礼，你将有机会见到400米全国冠军保罗·金，他将会来到开幕现场，他会待到中午左右，与前来会面的粉丝聊天并签名。

Then there will be a whole range of special attractions all weekend.

There will be free tickets for local sporting events for the first 50 customers, and also a special competition open to all.

前50名到场顾客，可以得到免费的当地体育赛事门票，还有会一个对面所有顾客的特别比赛。

One of the special opening offers is a fitness test - a complete review of your cardiac fitness and muscle tone, actually done in the shop by qualified staff.

一个开业酬宾活动是健康测试，对你心脏健康和肌肉紧张度的全面评估，就在店里由有资历的员工进行。

This would normally cost £30.00 but is available at half price for this month only.
